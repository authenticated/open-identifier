# Open Identifier

Open Identifier is a project which attempts to solve an issue which plagues the advertising industry:  How to integrate two different ad systems which use different identifier for members of their viewing audience.

## Functions

Open Identifier serves to provide the following functions:

**Identification**

* Use latest technologies to provide a consistent fingerprinting of users
* Respect "do not track" functionality standards
* Maintain multiple IDs for different fingerprinting methodoligies

**Mapping**

* Anonomize user identification, therefore providing a guarantee that customer data is kept solely with the owner
* Simplify the process of cookie mapping by an ad platform - one map to Open Identifier is all that is needed
* Reduce data leakage by reducing the number of mappings needed for a full bid transaction to be executed
* Reduce web traffic, thus making pages serve faster

## Anonomize User Identification

By using Open Identifier, advertisers and publishers add an open identifier tag to their web page.  An IFRAME is created, and a script runs to check which platforms have already synced with Open Identifier.  Up to five additional platforms are sync'ed inside the IFRAME, so the platform cannot use referrer data to see which site the user is visiting. 

## User Mapping

Currently, the way that this is solved is through a process called "cookie mapping".  The process of cookie mapping is as follows:

1. Company A wants to integrate with Company B, so they agree to a "partnership"
2. Company A adds a beacon to their online artifacts (ads, scripts, etc.) which calls a URL owned by Company B
3. The user identifier and partner identifier are sent to Company B - e.g. `http://company-b.com?partner=company-a&id-abcdefg&redirect=company-a.com?id=abcdefg&company-b-id=`
4. Company B redirects back to Company A with their user ID via a 302 redirect - e.g. `http://company-a.com?id=abcdefg&company-b-id=1234567`
5. Now, both Company A and Company B have the audience member's ID from both companies.

The problem with this method is that there is a growing number of ad companies, and these companies partner with lots of other companies.  What seems like a straightforward solution for two companies becomes complex as the number of companies grow.  For example, if Company A worked with 7 other companies, there would be a total of 54 requests, whereas if each company just worked with a central hub, there would be 16 requests, less than 1/3 the amount of web traffic:

The following are benefits:

1. Faster rendering of pages/apps and ads
2. Greater coverage of data
3. Easier server side integrations (like with Server Side Header Bidding)

The Open Identifier domain would perform the following functions:

1. Store the audience member's ID in the cookie space of the browser for its domain (open.identifier.online)
2. Generate a new ID for a member that does not yet have an ID
3. Redirect to the calling script the Open Identifier for the audience member if it can be determined

There is nothing stored on any server that powers the Open Identifier domain.

## User ID Format

The format of the user ID is as follows:

```
id = [id1]_[id2]_[id3]...x
p = [partner_p1]|[p1_last_sync_dt]_[partner_p2]|[p2_last_sync_dt]|...
```


The code that is running on the domain is included in this project, and is open source, with the MIT license.
